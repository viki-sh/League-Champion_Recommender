       " 'Abilities': [\"Innate: Periodically, Aatrox empowers his next basic attack to gain \\xa050 bonus range and deal Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)bonus magic damage equal to Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)4% − 12% (based on level) of the target's maximum health, capped at 100 against  monsters. Aatrox  heals for 80% of the post-mitigation bonus damage dealt, reduced to 25% against  minions. Whenever Aatrox hits at least one enemy  champion or large  monster with a basic attack  on-hit or an ability, the \\xa0cooldown of Deathbringer Stance is reduced by 2 seconds, modified to 4 if he hits with the Champions killed with Living Artillery (R)Sweetspot of  The Darkin Blade. Aatrox can activate The Darkin Blade three times before the ability goes on cooldown, with a 1-second static cooldown between casts. If Aatrox does not recast the ability within 4 seconds of the previous cast, it goes on cooldown. Active: Aatrox performs a strike with his greatsword for each of the three casts, dealing Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage to enemies hit within an area. Enemies hit within a Champions killed with Living Artillery (R)Sweetspot of the area take  60% bonus damage and also  knocked up for 0.25 seconds. Each subsequent cast increases The Darkin Blade's damage by 25%. First Cast: Aatrox's first strike affects a 625\\xa0×\\xa0180-unit rectangular area in the target direction, with him centered on the back line and the Champions killed with Living Artillery (R)Sweetspot at the farthest edge. Second Cast: Aatrox's second strike affects a trapezoidal area in the target direction, with the Champions killed with Living Artillery (R)Sweetspot at the farthest edge. The hitbox begins 100-units behind Aatrox and extends 475-units in front of him, measuring between 300 and 500-units wide from behind to in front. Third Cast: Aatrox's third strike affects a 300-radius circular area centered on a target location that is 200 units in front of him, with a 180-radius Champions killed with Living Artillery (R)Sweetspot within. The Darkin Blade deals 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% (based on level) damage against  minions, and the  knock up duration from hitting the Champions killed with Living Artillery (R)Sweetspot is doubled to 0.5 seconds against  monsters. Active: Aatrox sends a chain in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to the first enemy hit, doubled against  minions, and  slowing them for 1.5 seconds. If this hits an enemy  champion or large  monster, a  tether is formed between the target and the ground beneath them for 1.5 seconds, during which they are  revealed. If the tether is not broken by the end of its duration, the target is dealt the same Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage again and  pulled to the center of the area. Passive: Aatrox  heals for 16% Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)(+ 0.9% per 100 bonus health) of non- persistent post-mitigation damage he deals against enemy champions. Active: Aatrox  dashes in the target direction. Umbral Dash  resets Aatrox's basic attack timer and can be cast during his other abilities without cancelling them and vice versa. Active: Aatrox unleashes his true form for 10 seconds,  fearing nearby enemy  minions and  monsters for 3 seconds, during which they are gradually  slowed by up to 99% over the duration. He also gains  ghosting and \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed that decays by 10% of the current bonus every 0.25 seconds, lasting until World Ender has ended. Whenever Aatrox scores a champion  takedown, he extends the duration by 5 seconds and becomes unleashed again. During World Ender, Aatrox gains Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range\\xa0bonus attack damage and 5% increased size, and receives increased  self-healing from all sources. \",\n",

At 9 stacks, she consumes them to Champions hit with Powder Kegs (E) detonated by chain reaction\\xa0heal herself for 35 − 95 (based on level) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 20% AP). Additionally, whenever Ahri scores a champion  takedown within 3 seconds of damaging them, she brings their essence to her to consume it to Champions hit with Powder Kegs (E) detonated by chain reactionheal herself for 75 − 165 (based on level) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 30% AP). Active: Ahri sends her orb in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies hit. At maximum range, the orb homes back to her to deal the same in Skillshots dodged with Void Surge (Q) \\xa0true damage to enemies hit. Enemies can be hit only once per pass. Active: Ahri gains Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)\\xa040% bonus movement speed that decays over 2 seconds and conjures three flames which orbit her clockwise for up to 2.5 seconds. After 0.25 seconds of the cast, each flame targets a  visible enemy based on priority, or after 0.4 seconds, simply targets the closest visible enemy in range. Each flame deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage, with subsequent flames against a target dealing 30% damage. Flames prioritize enemy champions hit by  Charm, then enemy  champions, then minions that would die to Fox-Fire's damage, and then the target of Ahri's last basic attack within 3 seconds. Fox-Fire's damage is doubled against  minions below Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)\\xa020% maximum health. Active: Ahri blows forth a kiss in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to the first enemy hit,  knocking them down and  charming and  slowing them by 65% for a duration. Active: Ahri  dashes to the target location and then fires essence bolts to up to 3 nearby  visible enemies, each dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage. Spirit Rush can be recast twice more within 15 seconds of the activation at no additional cost, with a 1-second static cooldown between casts. Consuming a champion's essence with  Essence Theft while Spirit Rush is active extends the recast duration by and up to 10 seconds, and grants an additional recast, storing up to 3 recasts at a time. Recast: Ahri mimics the first cast's effects. Spirit Rush's recast duration will persist even after using all recasts.  Fox-Fire can be cast during the dash. Spirit Rush will cast at max range if cast beyond that. \",\n",
       "  \"Innate: When Akali damages an enemy  champion with an ability, she creates a ring around them for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent damaging abilities against champions. For 2 seconds, she gains Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)30 / 40 / 50 / 60% (based on level) \\xa0bonus movement speed while moving away from the center of the ring. Only one ring may be active at a time. When Akali exits the ring, for 2 seconds, she regains the Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed while facing nearby enemy champions and becomes empowered with Swinging Kama for 4 seconds, during which she cannot create another ring. Swinging Kama: Akali's next basic attack is empowered to have its \\xa0range doubled and deal 35 − 182 (based on level) Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 60% bonus AD) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 55% AP) Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)bonus magic damage. Active: Akali unleashes kunais in a cone in the target direction, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies hit. Targets beyond a certain range are also  slowed by 50% for 0.5 seconds. Active: Akali restores \\xa0Champions hit with Hookshot (E)100 energy over 0.4 seconds and gains \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed that decays over 2 seconds. She also detonates a smoke bomb a fixed distance away in the target direction, creating a circular shroud that expands over the next 5 seconds into a ring. The shroud does not permeate terrain, and will expand toward nearby enemy champions. While the shroud is active, Akali's Champions hit with Hookshot (E)maximum energy is increased by inherit100. Entering the shroud renders Akali  invisible, unless she is  dashing. Declaring a basic attack or casting an ability will break the invisibility and prevent Akali from entering it for 1 − 0.625 (based on minutes) seconds, refreshing on subsequent attacks and casts. The  marked section of Twilight Shroud will linger for the mark's duration, even after the shroud ends. Active: Akali  flips backward and, after the cast time, throws a shuriken in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to the first enemy hit. The shuriken marks and  reveals the enemy or the last  smoke section hit for 3 seconds, during which Shuriken Flip can be recast to consume the mark. Recast: Akali  dashes towards the marked target or smoke section. Against enemies she deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage upon arrival. Akali will not flip backwards if she is  immobilized or  grounded during the cast time.  Twilight Shroud and  Perfect Execution can be cast during the recast's dash. Active: Akali  dashes 750 units in the direction of the target enemy  champion, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies she passes through. If this hits an enemy, she flips over them to continue the dash up to the normal range but for at least another 150 units. Perfect Execution can be recast after a 2.5-second static cooldown within 10 seconds of the first activation. Recast: Akali  dashes 800 units in the target direction, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies she passes through, increased by Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)0% − 200% (based on target's missing health). \",\n",
       "  \"Innate: Whenever Akshan uses a basic attack, he fires an additional shot after a delay that deals Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)50% AD Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage, increased to Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)100% AD against  minions. If this shot is cancelled, he gains Damage mitigated by Master-At-Arms (R)20 − 75 (based on level) \\xa0×\\xa0 Champions hit with Martial Cadence (P)(1 + 100% bonus attack speed) Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)\\xa0bonus movement speed decaying over 1 second.

The third stack against a target consumes them all to deal them Damage mitigated by Master-At-Arms (R)15 / 40 / 80 / 150 (based on level) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 60% AP) Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)bonus magic damage; if the target is a  champion, Akshan will also gain a 40 − 280 (based on level) Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 35% bonus AD)  shield for 2 seconds. The shield may be gained only once every few seconds. Active: Akshan throws a boomerang in the target direction that briefly grants  sight around its trajectory and deals Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage to enemies hit,  revealing them for 1 second and extending its range each time it hits a target. If this hits an enemy  champion, Akshan gains Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed that decays over 1 second. Once the boomerang has passed its original range and has not hit a target in the last 500 units of travelling, it homes back to Akshan and applies the same effects to enemies hit. Avengerang's deals reduced damage against non-champions. Enemies can be hit only once per pass. Passive: Akshan marks enemy  champions that kill allied champions as Scoundrels for 60 seconds. If Akshan scores a  takedown against a Scoundrel while alive and within 3 seconds of damaging them, he receives an additional  100 and revives all  dead allied champions that they have slain after 1 second. When Akshan claims a Scoundrel's bounty he removes the marks of all other enemies. Scoundrels refresh their mark duration on subsequent kills, and will have their mark removed when they die by any means. Akshan cannot mark enemies as Scoundrels while they are dead. Allies are revived at their summoning platform. Active: Akshan enters  camouflage, which lasts indefinitely while he is near terrain or inside  brush, and for 2 seconds otherwise. During this time. he can see trails leading toward Scoundrels, and while facing them if they are within 5000 units, he gains Champions hit by Piltover Peacemakers (Q) at greater than 75% of max range\\xa0bonus mana regeneration equal to Champions hit by Piltover Peacemakers (Q) at greater than 75% of max range12% of his missing mana as well as Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)\\xa0bonus movement speed. Going Rogue can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after its duration. Attacking or casting abilities ends Going Rogue immediately. Recast: Akshan ends Going Rogue. Active: Akshan can activate Heroic Swing three times before the ability goes on cooldown, and can use the third cast only after 0.5 seconds of the second cast. Akshan may input an attack or movement command to use the second and third casts. First Cast: Akshan fires a hook in the target direction that embeds in the first terrain hit, and enters preparation for up to 2.125 seconds. Heroic Swing's second cast can be used while the hook is attached. If the hook fails to attach or Akshan is moved or becomes  immobilized,  grounded, or  polymorphed within the duration, the preparation will end prematurely, cancelling Heroic Swing in the process. Second Cast: Akshan  swings around the terrain in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction based on the position of the cursor relative to his facing direction, stopping upon colliding with an enemy champion or terrain. While swinging, he fires at the nearest  visible enemy every 0.231 seconds to deal them Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage and apply  on-hit effects at 25% effectiveness per shot.Akshan will be  knocked down by any  immobilizing or  polymorphing crowd control during the dash. Third Cast: Akshan ends the swing by  jumping to the target location, though not through terrain, and fires one last shot at a nearby  visible enemy. Scoring an enemy champion  takedown reduces Heroic Swing's \\xa0current cooldown to 0.5 seconds. The shots can  critically strike for「\\xa0Champions killed from outside standard Attack range(157.5%\\xa0+\\xa0 36%) physical damage\\xa0」「\\xa090% total \\xa0Damage mitigated with Pale Cascade (W)critical damage\\xa0」and apply \\xa0life steal at 100% effectiveness.  Avengerang and  Going Rogue can be cast during the third cast's dash.  Comeuppance can be cast at all points during Heroic Swing, though Akshan cannot fire during the swing while it is active. Akshan prioritizes firing at enemy champions with stacks of  Dirty Fighting, then those damaged by his targeted spells in the last 4 seconds, then the nearest enemy. Heroic Swing can be cast during Akshan's other abilities. Active: Akshan locks onto the target enemy champion and begins  channeling for 2.5 seconds,  revealing them as well as  revealing himself. He gradually stores bullets into his weapon over the duration. Comeuppance will recast after the duration, or can recast early after 0.5 seconds. Comeuppance is placed on a \\xa05-second cooldown if the channel is cancelled. Recast: Akshan fires all stored bullets at the target, each briefly granting  sight around their trajectory and dealing Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage to the first enemy hit, increased by Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)0% − 200% (based on target's missing health). The shots can hit structures. Each bullet's damage applies \\xa0life steal at 100% effectiveness, and  executes  minions. Akshan can move while channeling Comeuppance. \",\n",

       "  \"Innate: Aphelios has access to an arsenal of 5 Moonstone Weapons, created by his sister Alune. He equips two weapons at any one time, one as his Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon and one as his Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand. Each weapon has a unique basic attack and passive effect. Aphelios begins the game with  Calibrum as his Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon and  Severum in his Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand, with  Gravitum,  Infernum, and  Crescendum queued in reserve. The queue order can be rearranged based on weapon usage. Innate - Moonlight: Weapons spawn with 50 Moonlight for ammunition, which is consumed on basic attacks on-attack or to cast his  abilities. Abilities that cause Aphelios to attack do not cost additional Moonlight on top of their ability cost. Once his Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon is exhausted of Moonlight, it is moved to the end of the queue and Aphelios assembles his next available weapon over 1 second to equip it from his reserve, with its  ability being placed on a 1.5-second \\xa0cooldown before that time. Aphelios cannot cast  Phase during the assembly. Innate - Weapon Master: Aphelios cannot improve his abilities with skill points. He starts the game with  Phase and gains access to  abilities at level 2 and  Moonlight Vigil at level 6, with the latter improving automatically at levels 11 and 16. Instead, Aphelios may spend his skill points to gain Champions hit with Bandage Toss (Q) at greater than 75% of max range\\xa0bonus attack damage, Champions hit with Martial Cadence (P)\\xa0bonus attack speed or \\xa0Champions damaged by Smoke Screen (W)lethality. The active effect of Aphelios'  varies based on his current Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon. The individual actives do not share a cooldown. Aphelios gains \\xa0100 bonus attack range while Calibrum is his Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon. Enemies damaged by Calibrum through an ability are marked for 4.5 seconds,  revealing them for the duration. Aphelios'  next basic attack against a marked target uses the current Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand weapon and has \\xa01800 range, increased missile speed, and a brief cast time that lasts shorter based on Aphelios'  proximity to the target. The empowered attack will consume the marks from all targets, dealing inherit15 Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 20% bonus AD) Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangebonus physical damage to the main target for each mark consumed. If Calibrum is the current Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand weapon, the Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon is used for the attack instead. Active: Aphelios fires a bolt of energy in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated by Master-At-Arms (R)60 − 160 (based on level) Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 42% − 60% (based on level) bonus AD) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 100% AP) Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage to the first enemy hit. Basic attacks with Severum are  non-projectile and have an  uncancellable windup. Severum's attacks  heal Aphelios for 2% − 7.1% (based on level) of the post-mitigation damage dealt, increased to 5% − 17.75% (based on level) for attacks from abilities. Healing from Severum in excess of Aphelios'  Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)\\xa0maximum health is converted into a  shield for an amount of up to 10 − 140 (based on level) Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)(+ 6% maximum health), lingering for up to 30 seconds.

Attacks alternate between Severum and his current Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand weapon, each dealing Damage mitigated by Master-At-Arms (R)10 − 40 (based on level) Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 22% − 40% (based on level) bonus AD) Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage, affected by  critical strike modifiers, and applying  on-hit damage at 25% effectiveness. Aphelios cannot cast  Phase nor  Moonlight Vigil during Onslaught, but he is still able to move. He cannot perform attacks while unable to declare basic attacks. Basic attacks with Gravitum  slow enemies by 30% for 2.5 seconds, decaying to 10% after 0.7 seconds.  Gravitum - Active: Aphelios expunges all enemies with Gravitum's  slow debuff, dealing Damage mitigated by Master-At-Arms (R)50 − 140 (based on level) Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 32% − 50% (based on level) bonus AD) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 70% AP) Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage and  rooting them for 1 second. Binding Eclipse also empowers in-flight Gravitum projectiles to instantly affect their targets upon applying the slow successively. Basic attacks with Infernum shoot a fire bolt that upon arrival splits into a cone of 4 lesser bolts behind the target, dealing damage to enemies they pass through. The fire bolt deals Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)110% AD Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage to the primary target. Secondary targets hit by any bolt are dealt Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)82.5 / 110% (based on level) AD Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage, reduced to Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)25.3 / 33% (based on level) AD against  minions.  Critical strikes also apply to damage dealt to secondary targets and instead spray 6 missiles in a 50% wider cone that deals \\xa0Damage mitigated with Pale Cascade (W)critical damage.

After 0.25 seconds, Aphelios then fires a volley of attacks at each locked-on target from his current Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand weapon, dealing Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)100% AD Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage and applying  on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. The damage is affected by  critical strike modifiers. There is no \\xa0range limit for locked-on targets. Basic attacks with Crescendum hurl the blade at the target, which lingers for 0.25 seconds before homing back to Aphelios. He is unable to declare basic attacks until he retrieves Crescendum, but the attack timer is reset once caught. Whenever Aphelios casts an ability that would require him to throw Crescendum, he instead fires a spectral Chakram at the target that similarly returns to him. Aphelios accumulates the Chakrams he catches, up to 20, which last for 5 seconds or until Crescendum is depleted of Moonlight. Attacks with Crescendum against  champions will refresh the duration of Chakrams. Basic attacks with Crescendum are empowered to deal Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)0% − 138.5% (based on number of Chakrams) AD Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangebonus physical damage and have a 10.67% wind up percentage, decreased to 6.67% when  critically striking. The bonus damage from Chakrams is affected by  critical strike modifiers. Active: Aphelios deploys a lunar sentry at the target location that arms after 0.35 seconds, lasting for up to 20 seconds, during which it is inactive and  untargetable. The sentry activates if an enemy is within range of it, reducing its duration to 4 seconds and becoming targetable. Sentries have Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)6 health and take 3 damage per  ranged basic attack and 4 damage per hit by abilities.  Turret attacks destroy sentries instantly. The sentry grants  sight of its surroundings and autonomously attacks the nearest visible enemy in range with a replica of Aphelios'  current Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand weapon, dealing Damage mitigated by Master-At-Arms (R)35 − 125 (based on level) Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 42% − 60% (based on level) bonus AD) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 50% AP) Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage per hit. The sentry can  critically strike and benefits from both Aphelios' \\xa0Champions hit with Martial Cadence (P)attack speed and \\xa0Time champions spent slowed by Miasma (W)critical strike chance at 100% effectiveness. See Pets for more details about the sentry. Sentry will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Active: Aphelios switches between his Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon and Number of times Skaarl resummoned with Courage (P3) away from your baseoff-hand weapon over 0.25 seconds. The icon of this ability reflects the next weapon that is in reserve. Active: Aphelios receives a text prompt of the weapon Alune will create next. Active: Aphelios casts forth a lunar spotlight in the target direction that briefly grants  sight of the area along its path and stops upon illuminating an enemy  champion. Alune smites the area centered on the illuminated target, dealing Damage mitigated by Master-At-Arms (R)125 / 175 / 225 (based on level) Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)(+ 20% bonus AD) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 100% AP) Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage to enemy champions struck and locking-on to each target hit, as well as granting  sight of the area for 2 seconds. After 0.3 seconds of the illumination, attacks based on Aphelios'  current Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)main weapon will launch from the sky against each locked-on target, dealing Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)100% AD with  Calibrum or  Gravitum, Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)105% AD with  Severum or  Crescendum, Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)110% AD with  Infernum Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage and applying  on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness.

The beam collides with the first enemy hit to  reveal them and deal Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage every 0.125 seconds, reduced to 50% for other surrounding enemies hit by the beam. The beam will deal a burst of  Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)bonus magic damage for each full second that it damages the same enemy, and generates Sweet spot hits on champions with The Darkin Blade (Q)2 Stardust if the target is a  champion.

Once the pulse has fully expanded, it manifests a circular rift to the Spirit Realm for a duration. While Aurora is inside the rift, she doubles the \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed granted by  Realm Hopper. Aurora and enemies within the rift are trapped inside. If Aurora collides with the border, she  dashes to the diametrically opposite side of the rift over 0.4 seconds, becoming  untargetable and  unable to act during the travel.

Active: Bard fires an energy bolt in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to the first enemy hit and  slows them by 60% for a duration. After Cosmic Binding hits an enemy, the bolt continues behind them for 300 units. If the bolt hits terrain or a second enemy, it  stuns both targets for the same duration, dealing the same damage to the secondary target. Active: Bard conjures a shrine at the target location that gathers power over 5 seconds, granting  sight of its surroundings for 1.8 seconds. Shrines last until they are consumed by champions moving over them. Up to 3 shrines may be active at a time. If the champion was an ally or Bard himself, they are  healed for an amount based on the shrine's power and gain \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed that decays over 1.5 seconds. Bard periodically stocks a Caretaker's Shrine charge, up to a maximum of 2. Active: Bard opens a one-way magical corridor through a piece of terrain in the target direction for 10 seconds. A champion can  pass through the corridor by selecting it, becoming  revealed during the travel. Bard and allies travel through the portal at 33% increased speed. A nearby valid piece of terrain is required to cast this ability. Magical Journey cannot be taken while  immobilized or  grounded. Active: Bard sends magical energy arcing to the target location, granting  sight of the area during travel. Upon impact, it puts all units within into  stasis for 2.5 seconds, as well as  stunning all enemy  champions,  minions, and  turrets struck for the same duration. Enemies hit are  revealed for the duration. Epic  monsters and  turrets are affected by Tempered Fate despite being  immune to crowd control. \",\n",

Against the first target, Void Surge can  critically strike for Champions killed from outside standard Attack range(175%\\xa0+\\xa0 40%) physical damage and applies  on-hit effects at 75% effectiveness and \\xa0life steal at 100% effectiveness. Void Surge deals Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangebonus physical damage to  monsters and modified damage against  minions. Void Surge can be cast only within a cardinal direction that is off cooldown, and incurs a cooldown between casts. Each cardinal direction has a unique \\xa0cooldown that is reduced equivalent to 0.25 ability haste per Champions hit with Martial Cadence (P)1% bonus attack speed. These cooldowns reset upon respawning. Void Surge  resets Bel'Veth's basic attack timer.

Every second attack  on-hit against the marked target deals  Skillshots dodged with Void Surge (Q) bonus true damage and generates a stack of Endless Banquet that increases this damage by the same value. This effect stacks infinitely, but is capped at 5 stacks against epic  monsters. The mark and stacks expire upon attacking a new target. Passive: When Bel'Veth scores a  takedown against an enemy  champion or epic  monster while alive, a Void Coral is spawned from their corpse for 15 seconds.  Baron Nashor, the pit  Rift Herald, and  Voidgrubs (once per spawn group) spawn an Enhanced Void Coral. Active: Bel'Veth  dashes to the target Void Coral to consume it over the cast time,  slowing nearby enemies by 25% − 96% (based on seconds elapsed) for the duration. She then creates an explosion at the location to deal \\xa0Skillshots dodged with Void Surge (Q) true damage to enemies within, capped at inherit1500 versus monsters, and assumes her True Form for 60 seconds.\\nBel'Veth consumes all existing Void Corals at once, generating a stack of  Lavender for each one consumed.

If a target is hit, Briar  cleanses herself from all  crowd control and destroys her pillory over a cast time, afterwards  dashing to them with  displacement immunity. Upon arrival, she creates an explosion around the marked target that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to them and nearby enemies and  fears all non-marked targets for 1.5 seconds, during which they are  slowed by 35%.

Hematomania lasts until the mark is dispelled by any means, including Briar's or the target's death. Casting  Chilling Scream removes the target's mark and ends Hematomania early.

The stab deals Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage and applies  on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness. Fiora can cast any of her abilities during the dash. The target does not have to be  visible to be hit by this ability. Active: Fiora enters a defensive stance for 0.75 seconds, becoming  unable to act, preventing all incoming non- turret damage, and gaining debuff immunity and  crowd control immunity. Additionally, over the first 0.6 seconds of the duration, Fiora poises to strike, after which she sends a shock with her sword in a line in the target direction, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to all enemies hit until colliding with an enemy champion. The enemy champion struck is also  slowed and  crippled by 25% for 2 seconds. If Riposte negates at least one hostile  immobilizing effect, Fiora  stuns the target for the same duration instead. Active: Fiora empowers her next two basic attacks on-attack within 4 seconds to gain \\xa025 bonus range and \\xa0Champions hit with Martial Cadence (P)bonus attack speed. The first attack  slows the target by 30% for 1 second but cannot  critically strike. The second attack will  critically strike for \\xa0Damage mitigated with Pale Cascade (W)modified critical damage, including to  structures. Bladework  resets Fiora's basic attack timer. Passive:  Duelist's Dance's \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed is increased. Active: Fiora challenges the target enemy champion for 8 seconds, highlighting all four of their inheritVitals after a 0.5-second delay. While in effect,  Duelist's Dance does not identify new inheritVitals on Fiora's target. While near the target, Fiora gains  Duelist's Dance's \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed. If Fiora triggers at least one inheritVital before the target  dies, or triggers all four, she creates a  Victory Zone at their location for 2 − 5 (based on Vitals hit) seconds, which  heals Fiora and all allies within the area every second. Unlike  Duelist's Dance, the inheritVitals will continue to linger even if Fiora is not nearby. \",\n",

Active: Fizz  dashes to the target location while becoming  untargetable, balancing on his trident for 0.75 seconds, during which he can cast  Trickster after 0.15 seconds into the duration. He then begins to hop off of his trident over 0.5 seconds, afterwards becoming targetable and landing to create a splash that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to nearby enemies and  slows them for 2 seconds. While hopping off of the trident, Fizz may input movement commands to direct his landing. Playful will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Active: Fizz  dashes to the target location, hopping down and splashing onto the ground prematurely upon arrival to deal the same damage in a smaller radius but not applying the slow. Trickster will cast at max range if cast beyond that. Active: Fizz throws down a lure at the target location that attracts a shark, granting  sight of the area before it emerges to chomp at the lure after 2 seconds, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to nearby enemies,  knocking them back, though not through terrain, and  slowing them for 2 seconds. The further the lure travels in its initial flight, the larger the shark that is attracted; increasing Chum the Waters'  damage, slow, eruption radius and knock back distance. Guppy (<455): 40% slow, 200 eruption radius and 150 unit knock back distance. Chomper (455-910): 60% slow, 325 eruption radius and 250 unit knock back distance. Gigalodon (>910): 80% slow, 450 eruption radius and 350 unit knock back distance. Enemy  champions can intercept the lure while it is in flight, which attaches to them upon contact and causes the shark to emerge at their position after the same delay. The lure's holder is  slowed and  revealed for the duration and afterwards is impacted by the eruption but is  knocked up for 1 second instead of knocked back. Chum the Waters will cast at max range if cast beyond that. \",\n",

Effects based on percentage health consider Kled and  Skaarl's combined Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)maximum health. Being reduced to Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)\\xa00 health causes  Skaarl to flee, forcing Kled to be Dismounted, with all damage in excess of  Skaarl's health being ignored.

Possession: For 10 seconds, Viego assumes the enemy champion's form and gains their basic attacks, basic abilities, items, and base stats (based on Viego's level). He also gains a free cast of  Heartbreaker, which is initially placed on a \\xa01.5-second cooldown, and \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)10% bonus movement speed while facing enemy champions within 2500 units. Viego cannot use item actives, consumable items, nor the shop during Possession. Casting  Heartbreaker or attacking a Mist Wraith ends Possession immediately. Viego will preserve his Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)current health percentage between transformations. Passive: Viego's basic attacks are empowered to deal Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangebonus physical damage  on-hit, which has a minimum threshold and is capped at 80 against  monsters. This damage is affected by  critical strike modifiers. Additionally, his damaging abilities apply a mark to enemies hit for 4 seconds. Viego's next basic attack against a marked target is empowered to consume the mark  on-hit to strike a second time, dealing Champions stunned with Pyromania (P)20% AD Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 15% AP) Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage and  healing him for 135% of the post-mitigation damage dealt.

Active: Viego stabs in a line in the target direction that deals Champions killed from outside standard Attack rangephysical damage to enemies hit. Blade of the Ruined King deals Champions killed from outside standard Attack range15 bonus physical damage against monsters. Blade of the Ruined King's passive remains under  Possession, and while transformed, the second strike is instead converted to bonus damage on-hit which no longer applies on-hit effects but can still  critically strike (based on possessed stats). Active: Viego  charges while being  slowed by 10% for up to 3 seconds to increase Spectral Maw's missile range and  stun duration over the first second of the channel. Spectral Maw can be recast within the duration. If the charge completes without reactivation, Spectral Maw is cancelled and placed on \\xa0full cooldown. If the charge is  interrupted, it will be placed on a 3-second cooldown. Recast: Viego hurls a blast of mist in the target direction and  dashes a fixed distance in the same direction, though not through terrain. The mist deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to the first enemy hit and  stuns them for 0.25 − 1.25 (based on channel time) seconds. Spectral Maw  resets Viego's basic attack timer. Viego can cast any of his abilities during the dash.

While inside the mist, Viego gains \\xa0Champions hit with Martial Cadence (P)bonus attack speed. If he does not attack or cast abilities, he also gains \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed and  camouflage. Declaring a basic attack or casting an ability will break the camouflage and remove the Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed, preventing Viego from gaining them again for 1 second, increased to 2 seconds if he attacked a large  monster. This duration refreshes on subsequent attacks and ability casts. Harrowed Path can be cast during any of Viego's abilities. Viego cannot gain the camouflage nor Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed from Harrowed Path for 1 second if he casted it during  Spectral Maw's channel or started the channel while the mist was active. Active: Viego gains  displacement immunity over the cast time, then  blinks to the target location.

Steel Tempest's thrust is  interrupted if Yasuo is affected by  disarming crowd control during the cast time, but its \\xa0cooldown is reset to 0.1 seconds. If Steel Tempest is cast during  Sweeping Blade, it will instead affect enemies around Yasuo at the end of the dash, or doing so immediately at his landing location after  blinking while ending the dash prematurely.

It then drifts another 50 units over 3.75 seconds, blocking all hostile non- turret  projectiles that hit it and granting  sight of its surroundings. Active: Yasuo  dashes a fixed distance in the direction of the target enemy. Upon impact, he deals them Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage, becomes  ghosted for 2 seconds, and generates a stack of Ride the Wind for 5 seconds, which refreshes on subsequent hits and stacks up to 4 times.

Yone's body is  untargetable and is sent the same distance behind the cast location, though not through terrain, and is reclaimed when Soul Unbound ends. Spirit Form: Yone becomes  ghosted and gains \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)10% − 30% (based on seconds active) bonus movement speed. Enemy champions damaged by his basic attacks or abilities are marked. Each mark stores a portion of the post-mitigation damage that Yone deals to the target with his basic attacks and abilities. Activation resets  Way of the Hunter's current sword state. Soul Unbound can be recast after 0.5 seconds, and automatically does so after the duration. Recast: Yone  dashes back to his body with  displacement immunity, ending Spirit Form and detonating the marks on each champion to deal \\xa0Skillshots dodged with Void Surge (Q) true damage equal to the amount stored against each of them. After the cast time, he will  cleanse himself from all  immobilizing effects and  polymorphs* that were applied to him during it as well as all  blinds,  cripples and  drowsy effects. The automatic recast is delayed if Yone is winding up a basic attack or is unable to recast Soul Unbound under any circumstances, which includes if he cannot move or cast abilities. Soul Unbound will also immediately recast upon  death or entering  resurrection.

If she is  attached to an ally or does so within 4 seconds, they are healed for the same amount. Innate: While  attached to an ally, Yuumi grants them 2 permanent Friendship stacks whenever they kill enemy champions or minions. The ally with the highest Friendship stacks becomes Yuumi's Best Friend, which empowers her abilities with additional effects while she is  attached to them. Active: Yuumi fires an errant missile in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to the first enemy hit. If the target is a champion, they are also  revealed and  slowed by 20% for 1 second.  Attached Bonus: Yuumi  channels for up to 1.35 seconds to steer the missile at a slower speed. After being in flight for the same duration, the missile accelerates in its current direction to deal increased damage and apply a stronger slow against champions that decays to 20% over 2 seconds.  Best Friend Bonus: Prowling Projectile always applies its enhanced slow against champions and hitting a champion grants her Best Friend Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)bonus magic damage  on-hit for 5 seconds, increased by 0% − 75% (based on Anchor's critical strike chance).

Innate - Goo: Whenever Zac damages at least one enemy with an ability, he sheds a number of chunks of himself to a nearby location, landing towards nearby  visible enemy  champions and lasting for 6 seconds.\\n  Both Zac and enemy champions can interact with a chunk by being within 50 units of it: an enemy will destroy it, while Zac will consume it to  heal for Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)4% − 8% (based on level) of his maximum health. Innate - Cell Division: Periodically, upon taking  fatal damage, Zac enters  resurrection for 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level) seconds, instantly restoring Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)50% of his maximum health and becoming  untargetable and  unable to act for the duration. Zac then splits into four uncontrollable  bloblets away from his location, though stopping at terrain. After 1.5 seconds of the bloblets being  untargetable, they start moving toward Zac's location over the remaining duration. Any damage the bloblets receive, excluding damage dealt in excess of each of their Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)total health, is also redirected to Zac as \\xa0Skillshots dodged with Void Surge (Q) true damage. While in resurrection, Zac cannot take damage from sources other than the redirected damage from his bloblets. After the duration, Zac is revived with Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)10 – 50% maximum health. Zac will die once all bloblets are killed. See Pets for stats and details for bloblets.

This attack cannot  critically strike. If the two Stretching Strikes affect different targets, both are  rooted for 0.5 seconds and receive the same  slow. After a 0.4-second delay, Zac displaces them toward each other over 300-units, though not through terrain. If the two targets are near each other, they are instead slammed together through the displacement, dealing the initial Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage and  knocking them up and  stunning them for 0.25 seconds upon impact. Surrounding enemies are also dealt the initial Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage. Both Stretching Strikes (the cast and the empowered attack)  reset Zac's basic attack timer.

If this hits Ziggs, he will  dash up to 825 units away from the center.  Turret Explosion: The explosion also   executes enemy  turrets within that are below a Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)maximum health threshold. Ziggs does not  dash if he is  immobilized or  grounded. He can cast any of his abilities during the dash. Active: Ziggs scatters a cluster of 11 proximity mines over the target location that grant  sight of the area for 2 seconds, arming after 0.5 seconds and lasting for up to 10 seconds. Each mine within the area explodes upon contact with terrain or an enemy, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage and  slowing them for 1.5 seconds, as well as granting  sight of the area around the explosion for 2 seconds. An enemy takes 40% damage from subsequent mines. Active: Ziggs catapults the Mega Inferno Bomb to the target location, granting  sight within a 600 radius around its destination for 4 seconds. The bomb explodes upon arrival to deal Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies hit, increased by 50% against those in the epicenter. \",\n",
       "  'Innate: Zilean generates \\xa0Champions killed with Trueshot Barrage (R)2 / 3.5 / 5 / 6 / 12 (based on level) experience (does not count towards his own level up) every 5 seconds. Time in a Bottle is on cooldown when the game starts and becomes disabled when Zilean reaches level 18. When he has enough to level up an allied  champion, he can select them to  channel for 1.2 seconds after a 0.5-second cast time. The channel is  interrupted and disabled upon entering combat with enemy champions or taking damage from  turrets, placing it on a \\xa010-second cooldown. If Zilean interrupts it himself, it is placed on a 1-second cooldown, increased to 2 if he used a basic attack against a turret to do so. A successful channel levels up the target and rewards Zilean the same amount of Champions killed with Trueshot Barrage (R)experience for himself as well. Active: Zilean throws a ticking time bomb to the target location that grants  sight of its surroundings. The bomb will attach itself to units that move within the epicenter, or those hit directly,  revealing them. After 3 seconds, or when the attached unit dies, the bomb explodes to deal Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to nearby enemies. The bomb detonates immediately if another bomb attaches itself to the same unit,  stunning nearby enemies for a duration. Active: Zilean reduces the \\xa0remaining cooldowns of  Time Bomb and  Time Warp by 10 seconds each. Either  Time Bomb or  Time Warp must be on cooldown to cast this ability. Active: Zilean applies Time Warp to the target champion which lasts for 2.5 seconds. Time Warp: If the target is an ally, they gain Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)\\xa0bonus movement speed. If the target is an enemy, they are  slowed. Active: Zilean places a protective time rune on the target allied  champion or himself for 5 seconds. If the target takes  fatal damage within the duration, they enter  resurrection for 3 seconds, becoming  invulnerable,  untargetable, and  unable to act. Afterwards, they revive while being  healed.

       "  \"Innate: After casting an ability, Zoe empowers her next basic attack or  Spell Thief bolt within 5 seconds to become  non-projectile and deal 16 − 130 (based on level) Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R)(+ 20% AP) Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)bonus magic damage. Active: Zoe shoots a star in the target direction that explodes upon hitting an enemy, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to nearby enemies hit, reduced to 80% for enemies hit beyond the first. The total damage is increased by 0% − 150% (based on distance traveled). The star lingers at maximum range for 1 second, during which Paddle Star can be recast after 0.25 seconds in the duration. Recast: Zoe redirects the star in the target path, empowering it with increased speed and radius, and resetting its damage modifier on cast. The redirected star can travel until it reaches 800-units outbound from Zoe. Paddle Star's recast can be used while affected by  cast-inhibiting crowd control. Passive - Wheeeee: Whenever Zoe casts Spell Thief or a summoner spell, she gains \\xa0Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)bonus movement speed for a duration, and summons three bolts that orbit her for the next 10 seconds. If Zoe is not affected by  complete crowd control, she shoots one bolt at a time at the nearest non- sleeping enemy in range, prioritizing her attack target, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage with each bolt. Passive: Whenever an enemy champion casts a  summoner spell or  item active, they drop the corresponding Multiple champions hit with Between Worlds (R) Spell Shard onto the ground that grants  sight over a 100-radius area and remains for 40 seconds. Enemy  minions have a 10% chance to spawn with a random Damage to champions with H-28G Evolution Turrets or H-28Q Apex Turrets (Q)Spell Shard that drops and remains for 20 seconds if Zoe kills them. Allied champions that kill them will cause the orb to drop only if Zoe is nearby. Zoe can collect a Damage to champions with H-28G Evolution Turrets or H-28Q Apex Turrets (Q)Spell Shard for 60 seconds, and replace it by moving directly onto another Damage to champions with H-28G Evolution Turrets or H-28Q Apex Turrets (Q)Spell Shard. Active: Zoe mimics the active of the collected Damage to champions with H-28G Evolution Turrets or H-28Q Apex Turrets (Q)Spell Shard. Active: Zoe kicks a bubble in the target direction that bursts upon the first enemy hit, otherwise lingering at maximum range over 1 second, then becoming a trap for 5 seconds that bursts upon contact with an enemy. The bubble can move through terrain only once, but travels the entire distance as bonus range, and will fall short if it would enter terrain again. The burst deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to the target and inflicts them with  drowsy for 1.4 seconds, which gradually  slows them until they fall  asleep for 2.25 seconds. While the target is  asleep, they are inflicted with \\xa0Champions that have been made a Vessel by Test of Spirit (E)30% magic resistance reduction. The next instance of non- persistent damage that the  sleeping target takes from  champions, large  monsters or  turrets consumes the debuff to deal \\xa0Skillshots dodged with Void Surge (Q) bonus true damage equal to the post-mitigation damage dealt, capped at Sleepy Trouble Bubble's damage. The bonus damage is dealt before the triggering damage. Active: Zoe  blinks in the target direction and remains there for 0.75 seconds, during which she sets her Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R)movement speed to a inheritstatic 0 and has  unobstructed vision. Afterwards, she  blinks back to her casting position. Portal Jump  resets Zoe's basic attack timer. Zoe is unable to basic attack and cast her abilities and movement spells for 0.75 seconds after casting Portal Jump and for 0.5 seconds after blinking back. \",\n",
       "  'Innate: Periodically, Zyra spawns one or two inheritSeeds nearby that last for 30 seconds, granting  sight over the surrounding area for 1 second. After 1 second, enemy  champions can destroy Seeds by stepping on them. Zyra can only have a total of 8 Seeds planted at a time, preserving inheritSeeds spawned by  Rampant Growth over inheritSeeds spawned by Garden of Thorns. Active: Zyra sprouts thorny spines at the target location that appear after a 0.625-seconds delay, dealing Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies hit. If Deadly Spine hits a inheritSeed, it sprouts into a  Thorn Spitter that remains for 8 seconds. Active: Zyra plants a inheritSeed at the target location that remains for 60 seconds and grants  sight over the surrounding area, though decreasing in radius after 1 second. After 1.5 seconds, enemy champions can destroy the inheritSeed by stepping on it, which  reveals them for 2 seconds. Zyra periodically stocks a Seed charge, up to a maximum of 2. Killing an enemy generates 35% charge toward a Seed, increased to 100% for large enemies and whenever scoring an enemy  champion  takedown. Active: Zyra shoots a surge of vines in the target direction that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies hit and  roots them for a duration. If Grasping Roots hits a inheritSeed, it sprouts into a  Vine Lasher, which remains on the battlefield for 8 seconds. Active: Zyra summons a monstrous thicket at the target location that deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E)magic damage to enemies hit as it expands. After 2 seconds, the thicket snaps upward to  knock up enemies within for 1 second.  Plants hit by the thicket become enraged, restoring Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)\\xa050% of their current health, increasing their Champions killed with Comeuppance (R)maximum health by 50%, gaining 25% increased size and refreshing their duration while the thicket expands. Additionally they attack in a flurry, launching two shots per attack, dealing 「\\xa0150% damage per flurry.\\xa0」「\\xa075% damage per shot.\\xa0」 Stranglethorns will cast at max range if cast beyond that.
